```{r}
source("5layers_config.R")
```

```{r}
#transform data to matrixes

x_train_matrix <- x_train %>% as.matrix()

x_test_matrix <- x_test %>% as.matrix()
```


Model created with Keras library functions. The net contains 3 dense hidden leayers.
```{r}
model <- keras_model_sequential()
model %>%
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS_FIVE$first_units, activation = firstLayerActivation, input_shape = ncol(x_train_matrix)) %>%
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS_FIVE$second_units, activation = secondLayerActivation) %>%
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS_FIVE$third_units, activation = thirdLayerActivation) %>%
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS_FIVE$fourth_units, activation = fourthLayerActivation) %>%
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS_FIVE$first_units, activation = fifthLayerActivation) %>%
  layer_dense(units = ncol(x_train_matrix))

summary(model)

model %>% compile(
  loss = lossFunction,
  optimizer = optimizer_adam(lr = learningRate),
  metrics = 'accuracy'
)

checkpoint <- callback_model_checkpoint(
  filepath = "5layers.hdf5", 
  save_best_only = TRUE, 
  period = 1,
  verbose = 1
)

early_stopping <- callback_early_stopping(patience = 5)
```
Fitting model due to configuration described in 5layers_conf.R file.
```{r}
#fidding model with only normal requests.
model %>% fit(
  x = x_train_matrix,
  y = x_train_matrix, 
  epochs = maxEpochs, 
  batch_size = batchSize,
  validation_split = 0.1
  )
#   validation_data = list(x_test, y_test)
#  callbacks = list(checkpoint, early_stopping)
```
